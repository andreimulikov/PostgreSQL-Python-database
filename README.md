# PostgreSQL-Python-database
Creating a table with Manchester United players in a PostgreSQL database using Python and the psycopg2 module.

1. First you need to install PostgreSQL and create a database.

2. Install the psycopg2 module to connect to PostgreSQL and execute SQL queries:
   
   ```
   pip install psycopg2
   ```
3. Use your PostgreSQL password and database name to connect to the database. User and host are used by default.

4. After a successful connection, a table is created in which data about the players of the Manchester United football club is entered.

5. Final result. This is what a table looks like in a PostgreSQL database.
